# wordlist-generator
Wordlist Generator for Bruteforce attacks (Use this for testing only)

Download the script and run:
 php wordlist-generator.php
 you'll be asked to answer on several questions like password length, directory where to save wordlist (it will create file if doesn't exist) , passwords counts (how many password combinations to generate)

 Note: if you use multiple times and the same directory, the generator will append the file with additional passwords, old password will still remain.
